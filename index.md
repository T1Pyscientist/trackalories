### Our policies

Our application needs the camera permission for taking pictures of your foods and sending them to our prediction model, a model hosted and mantained by IBM. This model only performs a prediction and doesn't store the data you could send on a photo.

Besides from that, all the other information is stored locally on your devicess without ever going out from there.

For any suggestion or question don't mind to write to silvestrijuanigancio@gmail.com
